pageTitle: Glue Framework Example Page
---
This is an example of a page generated by the Glue Framework using a markdown
source file. You can find the file that produced it at
`_glue-site/content/index.md`

This is far from the only way Glue can have content defined though. URLs can
be mapped to code or content in the following ways:

* **Markdown** files like this one
* **Redirects** -- `.url` files in the same folder as markdown will redirect to the url in their
  first line -- for an example see `_glue-site/content/example-redirect.url`
* **Routes** specified in PHP files in `_glue-site/routes` -- these must be enabled
  in `_glue-site/config/Route.yaml` before they will take effect. For an example
  see `_glue-site/routes/example.php`
* **Codepages** are an easy and familiar way of building simple mixed PHP/HTML
  pages. PHP files placed in `_glue-site/content` will be served as if they were
  markdown files. Code in them will execute in the namespace
  `\glue\codepages`.
* **AutoRoute** classes can be made by creating classes in the AutoRoute namespace.
  CamelCase class names will be converted to URLs such as `/camel-case`.
  Calls to those URLs and their subdirectories will be routed to the method
  `route()` in the class, with subdirectories passed as arguments.
  For example, given a class `\AutoRoute\SampleAutoRoute`, the url
  `/sample-auto-route/arg1/arg2` would result in a call similar to
  ```
  $handler = new \AutoRoute\SampleAutoRoute();
  $handler->route('arg1','arg2');
  ```
